I handcraft each lampwork bead using a torch, glass, and an assortment of tools.  No two pieces are ever identical.\n\nRemember that colors will vary from monitor to monitor. I&#39;ve tried to represent my lampwork glass pieces as close to reality as I can by taking photos in natural light whenever possible.\n\nI thoroughly inspect all of my glass pieces to ensure there are no flaws or cracks\n.....................................\n\nI prefer payment through PayPal.

Most of our sticker sheets, if not noted as half sheet, are 8.5&quot;x11&quot;. We leave our registration marks (the black boxes and lines in the corners) on our sheets so you have a FULL SHEET of stickers. While our sheets might not have nice rounded corners, this allows us to use the entire sheet, meaning more stickers for your money!\r\n\r\nHOURS OF OPERATION:\r\nMonday-Friday. We try to take off weekends. If you send a convo to us Saturday-Sunday, please be patient as we will get back to you on Monday.\r\n\r\nIf you love our stickers, but you don&#39;t need that many, or maybe you only want certain images from each sticker sheet, or maybe you are looking for smaller\/larger stickers?

This is the flavor that got me hooked on lip balms when I was 7, and I still love it!  \n\n\nForget about those commercial brands of lip balm where the main ingredient is petroleum. Once you try all natural lip balm you will never go back. This lip balm is so creamy and moisturizing you will only need to apply it once or twice a day. It lasts a very long time and actually moisturizes your lips instead of just coating them like the commercial brands do. I am completely addicted to lip balms and this has been a complete lip saver for me. I did a ton of research and played around with many different ingredients until I found the perfect balm. I use only natural ingredients and candililla wax instead of beeswax to keep it vegan. Because it contains unrefined cocoa butter, all balms will have a slight undertone of chocolate, which just adds to their yumminess.\n\nListing is for one .15oz round tube of lip balm. Tube can be recycled.\n\nWant more for less?

This will help the candle avoid \u201ctunneling\u201d or burning straight down the center, which can affect the scent throw of the candle. Allowing your soy candle to create its initial \u201cmemory burn\u201d will result in a complete burn and increased scent throw.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1442700332,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/CopperandKraftCandle?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/9689874\/iusb_760x100.15461905_ky64.jpg","num_favorers":2097,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/075\/0\/9689874\/isla_fullxfull.15836812_r52dowus.jpg"}}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":null,"keywords":"root beer","sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":null,"category":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false"},"type":"Listing","pagination":{"effective_limit":25,"effective_offset":0,"next_offset":25,"effective_page":1,"next_page":2}}
