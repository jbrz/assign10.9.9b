## This is a Readme

This is an Etsy copycat page.

For whatever reason, my initial template lacked underscore.js, and in the ensuing panic this morning, instead of trying to add it to my project files, I just started a newapp and attempted to copy-paste everything in.

It only sorta worked.  And I'm still having a couple CSS issues, because I'm pretty sure I offended the CSS gods at some point.
